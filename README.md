# FPM
**FiveM project manager**

The target of this resource is to provide clean & bug free code for easier development of fivem scripts with lua. It currently contains a few modules, which can be installed into a new resource by using the 'FPM.jar'. This will open a window where you can type the name of your resource and select the modules you want. It also automatically includes the required libraries. **BECAREFUL: THIS WILL OVERWRITE ANY EXISTING FXMANIFEST.LUA** This resource is far away from done and I would love to see this project grow, not only by me but also by anyone who is willing to help developing this resource. <br>
<br>
*I started to create this resource for personal use, so there are some things you still might need to change (like the author in the fxmanifest.lua). I am going to change that in future updates though.*<br>
